# 📚 Notes Sharing System

## Overview

This beginner-level full stack project enables students to build a **document-sharing platform** with **authentication and upload features**. It allows users (students or faculty) to upload, browse, and download categorized notes while ensuring security and ownership of the content.

The aim is to practice core full stack skills while also learning how to handle file uploads, organize shared resources, and apply role-based access if needed.

---

## 🚀 Goals of the Project

* Build a platform where users can upload and download study materials.
* Understand user authentication (signup/login/logout).
* Implement file upload, download, and preview features.
* Enable categorization and filtering of shared content.
* Introduce role-based access control (e.g., teacher vs. student).
* Ensure file security using basic malware detection or validations.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

> 📌 *The final tech stack will be discussed as a team.*
> Some recommended options:

* Frontend: React.js / HTML-CSS-JS
* Backend: Node.js with Express / Django / Flask
* Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* File Storage: Local or Cloud (e.g., AWS S3)
* Authentication: JWT / Sessions
* Virus Scanning (optional): VirusTotal API or similar
* Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## 🧱 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup

* Initialize frontend and backend boilerplate
* Create folder structure and basic routes
* Define DB schema: users, notes, categories

### Phase 2: User Authentication

* Signup, login, logout flows
* Token/session-based authentication
* Middleware for protected routes

### Phase 3: File Upload & Notes Sharing

* Allow authenticated users to upload notes
* Store metadata (title, subject, uploader, etc.)
* Link notes to the user

### Phase 4: Download, View & Filter

* Create a note listing page
* Add filters (category, uploaded by)
* Add file download and view details functionality

### Phase 5: Extras & Enhancements

* Improve UI with animations, tags
* Add role-based access (optional)
* Implement virus/malware scanning (optional)
* Make the platform responsive

## 📢 Contribution Guidelines

This guide walks you through how to **fork**, **clone**, **write code**, and **create a Pull Request (PR)** to contribute to the official Nexus Club fullstack project repository.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the main project repository link shared by the mentor.
2. Click the **"Fork"** button on the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

> 🛠 You’ll now have your own copy where you can push your changes safely.

---

## 💻 Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

1. Copy the HTTPS clone URL of your fork
   Example:

   ```
   https://github.com/your-username/notes-sharing-system.git
   ```
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/notes-sharing-system.git
   cd notes-sharing-system
   ```

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for every new feature or fix.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

> Example: `feature/upload-notes` or `bugfix/download-error`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 4: Make Changes

Now you're free to code!
Modify files, add new ones, or create your project folder as discussed with the team.

✅ Keep your code clean and readable.
✅ Test everything before committing.

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once you're done:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added: upload notes backend route"
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 📬 Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a banner to create a **Pull Request** — click it.
3. Choose the **base repository** (main club repo) and the branch (`main`) to merge into.
4. Add a **clear title** and **description** of what you’ve done.
5. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

Wait for the mentor or Fullstack Lead to review your changes and give feedback or approve it for merging.

---

## 🔁 Step 8: Stay Updated with the Main Repo

To avoid conflicts, regularly sync your fork with the main repo.

### Add the main repository as upstream (only once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nexus-club/notes-sharing-system.git
```

### Pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

Now continue from Step 3 again if you want to work on a new feature.

---

## 🙌 Final Notes

* Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
* Keep your branches clean and well-named.
* Follow naming conventions and formatting rules.
* Ask me (FullStack Lead) if you're unsure about anything.
